heading2_sub: "Probiotic cleaners use a balance of live bacteria to continue cleaning your home long after the product has been applied. Because bacteria is always changing its DNA, it's nearly impossible to continue creating products that kill them entirely. Just like when you take probiotics to keep your body healthy in our living spaces and free them of harmful and cancerogenic toxins, chemicals, and pathogens.<br><br>Use bacterias to your advantage! It's not unusual for people to think that all bacterias are bad, but it's not! There are types of good bacteria that are essential in protecting our health and homes. And good bacteria is at the core of probiotic cleaning products from ProfiClean. We take pride in NOT KILLING 99.9% of bacteria.
